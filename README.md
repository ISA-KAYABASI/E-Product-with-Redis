# ProductProcessing
I create a project which is able to control adding product and existing product state.

I create this CRUD project, we are able to add new products with productname, expiration date, price, currency and it is have the active passive state.
All this information filling a add another product to product list that we can see on ==>  http://localhost:8080/products ' port.
Meantime I am still working on the project to complete for rest of the desired parts.
I send the project with rar and after I complete I will send it back second time with everything completed.
Thank you for your time and consideration.

For to use application it needs to connect with  database and needs to add update application.properties options ==>

spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=root
