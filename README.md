# ProductProcessing
I create a project which is able to control adding product and existing product state.

I create this CRUD project, we are able to add new products with productname, expiration date, price, currency and it is have the active passive state.
All this information filling a add another product to product list that we can see on ==>  http://localhost:8080/products ' port.
Meantime I am still working on the project to complete for rest of the desired parts.
I send the project with rar and after I complete I will send it back second time with everything completed.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
